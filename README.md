# üåç TravelTide Customer Segmentation & Rewards Program
---

## üß† Overview

**TravelTide** is an online travel startup focused on improving customer retention by launching a **personalized rewards program**. They have 1 million users and 5 million unique app sessions. This project segments Traveltide customers based on website behavior to enable targeted perks using data-driven segmentation. To ensure meaningful results, the dataset was filtered to include **only users with more than 7 sessions since January 4, 2023**.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze behavioral data to identify trends.
- Segment users based on travel and booking behaviors.
- Recommend perks for each segment to maximize engagement:
  - üß≥ Free Checked Bag  
  - üè® Free Hotel Meal  
  - 1Ô∏è‚É£ Discount on First Travel  
  - üõãÔ∏è Airport Lounge Access
  - üéÅ 1 Free Hotel Night with Flight
  - ‚úàÔ∏è Free Flight
  - üí∫ Free Seat Upgradee

---

## üî® Tools Used

- SQL - for data cleaning and extraction
- Tableau - for visualization and pattern recognition

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources
 
The dataset consisted of four original tables:

- **Users**: Demographic information about each customer
- **Sessions**: Information about individual browsing sessions
- **Flights**: Information about purchased flights
- **Hotels**: Information about purchased hotel stays


From these, I created three working tables for the analysis:

- **Session-based table**: Cleaned and filtered session-level data with relevant activity metrics.
  - [Session-based table code]()
- **User-based table**: Aggregated customer metrics such as age, number of trips, session counts, and family status.
  - [User-based table code](https://www.notion.so/User-based-Table-23b52541c1658016b9e3fb15b8c5e56e?source=copy_link)
- **Final segmentation table**: Combined user attributes and behavior into defined customer groups and assigned a likely preferred perk.
  - [Final table code](https://www.notion.so/Final-Table-with-Customer-Groups-and-Assigned-Perk-23b52541c16580518459e3a61a5247b3?source=copy_link)
  - [Final Cleaned Dataset]()

#### üîç Data Filtering
To focus on engaged users, only **active users** were included in the analysis.
- Users with **more than 7 sessions since January 4, 2023**. 
  - 5,998 eligible users


#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Cleaning Notes
- Some records included **negative night stayed** due to check-out date occuring before check-in date.
  - This was caused by default or placeholder values in the check out field.
  - Affected rows were replaced with a value of **1** (night).

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Plan

1. **Data Cleaning & Filtering**  
   - Removed duplicate sessions  
   - Cleaned hotel booking data (e.g. adjusted negative nights)
   - Included sessions starting after January 4, 2023
   - Filtered for users with more than 7 sessions to ensure engagement

2. **User-Level Feature Engineering**  
   - Aggregated sessions into customer profiles
   - Calculated metrics like `age`, `num_clicks`, `avg_session_duration`, `num_flights`, `money_spend_hotel`, `avg_km_flown`, and   `time_after_booking`

3. **Customer Segmentation (SQL)**  
   - Created a decision tree to group users
   - Applied these rules using `CASE WHEN` logic  
   - Categories based on age, trip frequency, and family status

4. **Perk Assignment**  
   - Created visuals in Tableau to find traveler insights and patterns
   - EDA in SQL to find insights
   - Matched reward to each group‚Äôs top travel need

5. **Insights & Report**  
   - Created summaries and reports for stakeholders  
   - Offered marketing and product recommendations

## üîß Feature Engineering

Sample features created:

| Feature               | Description                                                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `num_sessions`        | Total sessions per user. Used to identify active users (7+ sessions).|
| `num_trips`           | Number of trips taken (excluding cancellations).                     |
| `age`                 | Derived from birthdate                                               |
| `cust_group`          | Final segmentation label combining age, travel frequency, and family status.      |
| `customer_perk`       | Assigned perk most likely to appeal to each group.                   |
| `avg_session_duration`| How long users spend on website. Behavioral insight                  |
| `money_spend_hotel`   | Hotel expenses. Behavioral insight                                   |
| `avg_km_flown`        | Avg. distance flown. Behavioral insight                              |

## üîç Segmentation Approach

- Decision Tree
- Users were segmented using SQL `CASE WHEN` logic based on **age**, **trip frequency**, and **family status**:

  ### üßÆ Segmentation Logic (SQL)
  
  ```sql
  CASE 
    WHEN has_children = TRUE THEN 'Family traveler'
    WHEN age > 60 THEN 'Senior traveler'
    WHEN age < 60 THEN 
       CASE
         WHEN num_trips <= 2 THEN 'Dreamers'
         WHEN age < 30 AND num_trips > 2 THEN 'Young frequent traveler'
         WHEN age > 30 THEN 
           CASE 
             WHEN num_trips > 5 THEN 'Business traveler'
             WHEN num_trips BETWEEN 2 AND 5 THEN 'Adult frequent traveler'
             ELSE 'Others'
           END
         ELSE 'Others'
       END
    ELSE 'Others'
  END AS cust_group;
  ```
